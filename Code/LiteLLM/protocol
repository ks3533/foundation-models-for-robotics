Attempt 1:
- no reasoning
- doesn't grip obj correctly
- doesn't understand the correct order of instructions
Yielded: grip object, open microwave, move abs (0, 0, -0.25)

Attempt 2:
- yes reasoning
- varying attempts to execute task
- 1:
    - doesn't grip obj correctly
    - doesn't understand the correct order of instructions
    Yielded: grip object, open microwave, then manual abort
- 2:
    - resolves object
    - tries to resolve microwave (error)
- 3:
    - doesn't grip obj correctly
    - wants to put object in microwave, even though closed, because wrong assumption that the door is open
- 4:
    - promising start:
        "To achieve the goal of thawing food in the microwave, the necessary steps are as follows:
        1. Open the microwave door.
        2. Grip the object "obj" to pick it up.
        3. Place the object inside the microwave.
        4. Close the microwave door.
        5. Press the button to turn on the microwave.
        6. Move at least 25 cm away from the object.
        I will start by opening the microwave door. Proceeding with that step now.
        Executing the first logical step: opening the door of the microwave."
    - success with step 1 and 2
    - error at step 3 while resolving microwave
Manual fixing of the resolving microwave
- 5:
    "1. Open the microwave (container).
    2. Grip the food object (obj) to pick it up.
    3. Move to the microwave and place the food inside.
    4. Close the microwave door.
    5. Press the button on the microwave to turn it on.
    6. Finally, move away from the microwave, ensuring I am at least 25 cm away.
    I'll begin by opening the microwave.
    Let's execute that step first."
    - doesn't grip object correctly
    - tries to move to (0, 0, 0) to move to the microwave, wrong assumption
Switch to high level subset
- 6:
    - fail because approach_destination_from_direction was in the subset (move to (0, 0, 0) indirectly)
Fix subset
- 7:
    - doesn't approach obj well
    - assumes door is open
Fix wrong assumption by adding to prompt
- 8:
    - excels at the task, except for dropping the object
    - uses no reasoning messages except for the last step
    "The operation has been successfully completed. Is there anything else you would like to address or any additional tasks you need assistance with?"
- 9:
    - aborted :(
- 10:
    - good plan, failed because of code problem
- 11:
    - skipped reasoning step(s), yet actually put the object into the microwave
    - failed because of close_door and the fact that that command still sometimes makes the arm get stuck
